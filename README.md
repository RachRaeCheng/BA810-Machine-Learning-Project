# BA810-Machine-Learning-Project
In this project, we aim to create a model that can effectively predict when customers might churn within a telecommunications company. The cost of acquiring new customers typically outweighs the expenses involved in retaining existing ones, an accurate churn prediction model can help the company allocate resources more effectively. Correctly predicting customers who are likely to churn can significantly benefit the company by reducing the overall costs associated with customer acquisition. This will help decrease customer turnover, improve customer satisfaction, and ensure better retention rates. We will use supervised machine learning techniques to build models that can classify customers as potential churners or non-churners based on their historical usage patterns, service plan features etc. This model will assist the company in identifying customers who are likely to leave in advance, enabling them to take timely actions to retain them.
